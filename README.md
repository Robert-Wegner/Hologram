# Hologram

This is the software for a proof of concept technology that can convert any ordinary screen into a rudimentary holographic/light field display.

A hexagonal array of glass beads is placed on the screen as can be seen in this picture: https://i.imgur.com/aFTCMD9.jpg

Each glass bead corresponds to one pixel of the holographic image. When viewed from different directions, it magnifies different groups of real screen pixels.
This makes it possible to create parallax and stereoscopic effects.

Here is a demonstration video:
